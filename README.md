# Datamining Multi-Class and Multi-Label Classification,  k-means clustering algorithm and Class Imbalance in Binary Classification Project
## Project Overview
This project contains solutions to several problems related to classification and clustering:

Multi-Label Classification: Train and evaluate SVM models with different kernels (Gaussian and Polynomial) on the Scene dataset.
K-Means Clustering: Implement k-means clustering from scratch on the Seeds dataset.
Class Imbalance in Binary Classification: Analyze and train models on the German Credit Card dataset while addressing class imbalance.
